> dhcpd-never-broadcast.diff

When using DHCP in routed networks, the router has to participate in rewriting
and sending DHCP replies on to the user.    Unfortunately, some devices,
in particular Cisco's Nexus series of switches, drop such DHCP reply packets
with the broadcast bit in the flags field of the DHCP message header set.
Thi means that some operating systems, in particular Microsoft Windows Vista,
can have problems getting DHCP to work in such environments.   If you enable
this flag, the DHCP server will never set the broadcast flags in the replies
it sends, even if the client set the broadcast flag.   This flag overrides
the never-broadcast flag if both are set.
